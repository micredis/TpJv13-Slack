ahoy! would it be just english-speaking-flooding-channel or especially-topjava13-dedicated-english-channel-ish?

I think more sensible would be make it a “bla-bla” channel, for english practice. We have a lot of channels for the topjava13 already. Sorry for the bad english btw. I’ve not had a practice for a while, so it is great to have it now %)

Possibly someone has worked with JSF and can answer - why server swears on updating primefaces-extensions dependency from 6.1.1 upto 6.2.RC1?

Hello! Nice channel, everybody needs practice in english (edited)

pro [11:22 AM]
@Alex83 Salute you;  channel is indeed necessary, and verily everyone of us needs to practise english, but from my eyes drops tears because of such a .LAZY conversation

Ilya [11:36 AM]
@pro I can’t get a pun) Explain, pls )

pro [12:08 PM]
@Ilya i meaned, that in this channel there are lot of people, but they do not particularly try to form their thoughts in the manner that is provided here.. therefore the dialogue freezes, even to death

Ilya [12:26 PM]
@pro oh, gosh) I thought u joked by .LAZY reference. Like .LAZY initialisation or smth ) I think i should take a break from learning, cause I’m starting to think like “JAVA IS EVERYWHERE!!! Watch out! It is coming for your soul” %)

pro [12:49 PM]
@Ilya people who communicates with me, notes the same thing that you did - that java is almost everywhere in my thoughts, but i don't care, cause i consolidate my knowledge in such a manner.. and i deliberately wrote that word as a constant (edited)

VladimirGlinskikh [12:19 AM]
Ahoy! Write to who and where teaches English.

mrLanu [12:24 AM]
YouTube, Udemy, iHeartRadio etc. (edited)
And Uber :grin:

mrLanu [12:38 AM]
Actually the best practise to improve your english skill is to get some native english lover))
Or buy a dog somewhere from UK

this monitor very slow and have no any perspective in future, I think. I'd buy pocketbook color lux some time ago, and regret for that.

Yevhen Maksymovych [9:32 AM]
yup, it seems like stillborn device. Can’t say large e-ink panels are useless stuff - depends on purposes - but not for all-day working with IDE. Delays on scrolling would make you sick. But I’ve seen 40” e-ink screen used as media informational board - and it was pretty awesome. Looked like old-fashioned newspaper-based boards from 80th :-)
And e-ink screens are still best choice for e-pocketbooks. I really fond of my kindle paperwhite )

Andrew [9:56 AM]
@pro thank you. it is.

pro [9:58 AM]
xD) had you tryed using a welding mask to avoid harmful influence on the eyes?
Maybe, i'll also buy this kind one (not mask but, of course, kindle book))
i had never felt any changes in my eyes, they serve me same as they'd been from eagle's) even if i have to work with cathode ray tube screens))

Andrew [10:09 AM]
if this screen will support many colors and if hi will be like "color lux" hi will be have a problem - to dark screen and have backlight and this backlights crosses out all the benefits of such devices.
If is not who want monochrom monitor in our days ?

pro [10:30 AM]
@Andrew don't you think its impossible for chinese experts to make a device, surpassing all it's analogues on a full head?

Yevhen Maksymovych [10:44 AM]
sure. first step - someone should invent it, second step - chinese experts would copy it making it cheaper, faster with built-in tv and bunch of slotes for sim-cards. there would be no second step without the first step.


Andrew [10:59 AM]
@pro ok) tell us about it when will buy it.
