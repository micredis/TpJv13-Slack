I think more sensible would be make it a “bla-bla” channel, for english practice. We have a lot of channels for the topjava13 already. Sorry for the bad english btw. I’ve not had a practice for a while, so it is great to have it now %)

Possibly someone has worked with JSF and can answer - why server swears on updating primefaces-extensions dependency from 6.1.1 upto 6.2.RC1?

Hello! Nice channel, everybody needs practice in english (edited)

pro [11:22 AM]
@Alex83 Salute you;  channel is indeed necessary, and verily everyone of us needs to practise english, but from my eyes drops tears because of such a .LAZY conversation

Ilya [11:36 AM]
@pro I can’t get a pun) Explain, pls )

pro [12:08 PM]
@Ilya i meaned, that in this channel there are lot of people, but they do not particularly try to form their thoughts in the manner that is provided here.. therefore the dialogue freezes, even to death

Ilya [12:26 PM]
@pro oh, gosh) I thought u joked by .LAZY reference. Like .LAZY initialisation or smth ) I think i should take a break from learning, cause I’m starting to think like “JAVA IS EVERYWHERE!!! Watch out! It is coming for your soul” %)

pro [12:49 PM]
@Ilya people who communicates with me, notes the same thing that you did - that java is almost everywhere in my thoughts, but i don't care, cause i consolidate my knowledge in such a manner.. and i deliberately wrote that word as a constant (edited)

mrLanu [12:24 AM]

Yevhen Maksymovych [9:32 AM]
yup, it seems like stillborn device. Can’t say large e-ink panels are useless stuff - depends on purposes - but not for all-day working with IDE. Delays on scrolling would make you sick. But I’ve seen 40” e-ink screen used as media informational board - and it was pretty awesome. Looked like old-fashioned newspaper-based boards from 80th :-)
And e-ink screens are still best choice for e-pocketbooks. I really fond of my kindle paperwhite )

Andrew [9:56 AM]
@pro thank you. it is.

pro [9:58 AM]
xD) had you tryed using a welding mask to avoid harmful influence on the eyes?
Maybe, i'll also buy this kind one (not mask but, of course, kindle book))
i had never felt any changes in my eyes, they serve me same as they'd been from eagle's) even if i have to work with cathode ray tube screens))

Andrew [10:09 AM]
if this screen will support many colors and if hi will be like "color lux" hi will be have a problem - to dark screen and have backlight and this backlights crosses out all the benefits of such devices.
If is not who want monochrom monitor in our days ?

pro [10:30 AM]
@Andrew don't you think its impossible for chinese experts to make a device, surpassing all it's analogues on a full head?

Yevhen Maksymovych [10:44 AM]
sure. first step - someone should invent it, second step - chinese experts would copy it making it cheaper, faster with built-in tv and bunch of slotes for sim-cards. there would be no second step without the first step.


Andrew [10:59 AM]
@pro ok) tell us about it when will buy it.


aleksey [1:33 AM]
I've spent a year in Shenzhen and i definitely can say that chinese guys can handle both steps themselves.

pro [6:57 AM]
@aleksey :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:  the only thing they can't completelly comprehend is how to use their goods inside their own country

Yevhen Maksymovych [9:38 AM]
whoa, @aleksey, is that true, that everyone here always tryin' to cheat laowai up? heard that's kinda natinal tradion in China

aleksey [1:03 PM]
@pro In fact, it isn't true. The Chinese domestic market is fantastically large, and most of chinese goods are destined to domestic market starting with food, clothes and ending with electronics, cars, trains and plains...and software especially=)) You can visit Taobao.com and observe chinese domestic market... and just dream about variety of goods, price and shipping speed. 3 days shipping from practically any corner of China.

aleksey [1:25 PM]
@Yevhen Maksymovych I lived in Shenzhen it's a 13million megalopolis in south of china, capital of world electronics, but 30 years ago it was just a fisherman village. So as you can understand, most of citizens are not native...and most of them are not even native city dwellers. And you can take away chinese guy from village but you will never take away village from chinese guy. Most of this yesterday villagers think that all of white people are fantastically rich and dream about giving them your money, sometimes it looks like cheating, but most of time it looks like cultural misunderstanding. E-commerce helps you not to pay directly and it hepls. Another deal is to have a business with chinese guys or work for them...that's kind of random fucking shit... but i think that it's not kind laowai cheating, it's kind of traditiaonal game to cheat with everyone, and chinese guys know the rules...and you not=)
But in fact Shenzhen is a great city, chinese guys there are closer to future in compare with us


dustnfox [8:03 AM]
Hello there. Is here someone who live (or lived) permanently in English-speaking country? Could you share your experience? I mean how difficult it was to start speak fluently and clearly understand native people. I'm asking because I've heard quiet opposite points of view. Someone told me it'd been piece of cake and they spoke free after just couple months of daily conversations with natives at work. But other claimed that even after several years of living in US (for example) they'd still felt unsettled when they have to communicate in English.

pro [10:23 AM]
@dustnfox surely they felt unsettled in communication on English, if they being living in english speaking country, but usually speaks russian with other same as they are, with  russian immigrants))

dustnfox [10:49 AM]
@pro Unfortunately, lack of the practice is not always the case. I've got a friend of mine who lived in the US for two or three years getting his degree. He had no friends in a Russian community. He graduated the University of Denver and therefore attended the classes all that time. So he had to talk in English almost every day disputing with other students over foreign policy (it was his major). Obviously, he was not at the Beginner or Intermediate level when he went there. He passed TOEFL exam. It was mandatory to go to the US university. But he confessed even though his English had been MUCH better at the end of his education, he still hadn't felt free in conversations with friends and colleagues.

pro [12:16 PM]
@dustnfox every man, as any cup, exists for containing and handling its own especially content; there is no man who boils tea in the cup for wines, or puts soup to the flat dish; if all people became the same as others, i think, they'll no need conversations or communication at all; Instead of thinking why the soup does not fit in a flat plate, you may find yourself in something more useful
