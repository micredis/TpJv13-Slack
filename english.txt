ahoy! would it be just english-speaking-flooding-channel or especially-topjava13-dedicated-english-channel-ish?

Ilya [1:54 PM]
I think more sensible would be make it a “bla-bla” channel, for english practice. We have a lot of channels for the topjava13 already. Sorry for the bad english btw. I’ve not had a practice for a while, so it is great to have it now %)

Possibly someone has worked with JSF and can answer - why server swears on updating primefaces-extensions dependency from 6.1.1 upto 6.2.RC1?  (quote: Critical error during deployment: : com.sun.faces.config.ConfigurationException: java.lang.Exception: No Function Found on type: org.primefaces.util.ComponentUtils with signature: java.lang.String escapeSelector(java.lang.String))

Hello! Nice channel, everybody needs practice in english (edited)

pro [11:22 AM]
@Alex83 Salute you;  channel is indeed necessary, and verily everyone of us needs to practise english, but from my eyes drops tears because of such a .LAZY conversation

Ilya [11:36 AM]
@pro I can’t get a pun) Explain, pls )

pro [12:08 PM]
@Ilya i meaned, that in this channel there are lot of people, but they do not particularly try to form their thoughts in the manner that is provided here.. therefore the dialogue freezes, even to death

Ilya [12:26 PM]
@pro oh, gosh) I thought u joked by .LAZY reference. Like .LAZY initialisation or smth ) I think i should take a break from learning, cause I’m starting to think like “JAVA IS EVERYWHERE!!! Watch out! It is coming for your soul” %)

pro [12:49 PM]
@Ilya people who communicates with me, notes the same thing that you did - that java is almost everywhere in my thoughts, but i don't care, cause i consolidate my knowledge in such a manner.. and i deliberately wrote that word as a constant (edited)

VladimirGlinskikh [12:19 AM]
Ahoy! Write to who and where teaches English.

mrLanu [12:24 AM]
YouTube, Udemy, iHeartRadio etc. (edited)
And Uber :grin:

mrLanu [12:38 AM]
Actually the best practise to improve your english skill is to get some native english lover))
Or buy a dog somewhere from UK
